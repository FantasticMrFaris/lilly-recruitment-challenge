# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation Template

*This documentation template serves as a place for you to discuss how you approached this challenge, any issues you faced & how you overcame them, or any other points that you feel would be relevant for the interviewers to know. The text in italics is here to guide you - feel free to remove it once you fill out each section!*

***Not every section in this document is required. This is just a template to help get you started. Feel free to add or remove sections as you feel necessary.***

## Approach
*How did you approach this challenge? Did you work through the objectives in any particular order? If so, why? Did you utilize any external resources, such as tutorials, guides, or other materials?*

//1. APPROACH
I began by thoroughly reading the README, the challenge objectives, and the specific requirements. I then created a structured to-do list outlining the key features I wanted to implement, including creating, adding, updating, and deleting medicines.

Because my background is stronger in TypeScript, I spent time watching JavaScript tutorials and reviewing its syntax to ensure I understood the language properly. I also looked at examples of clean UX design, created a base style.css template, and then incorporated it into the index.html.

## Objectives - Innovative Solutions
*For the challenge objectives, did you do anything in a particular way that you want to discuss? Is there anything you're particularly proud of that you want to highlight? Did you attempt some objectives multiple times, or go back and re-write particular sections of code? If so, why? Use this space to document any key points you'd like to tell us about.*


For the key objectives of the challenge, I focused on implementing the core functionality cleanly and in a way that demonstrated both understanding and practicality. I ensured that the create, add, change, and delete operations for medicines were all handled through clear JavaScript functions, each tied directly into the UI for an intuitive user experience.

I also ensured that data coming from the backend was displayed dynamically on the homepage, and I refined the logic for updating and presenting values.

Throughout the process, I revisited and improved several sections of the code as my understanding of JavaScript deepened. This included rewriting certain functions to make them more efficient and improving how the UI responded to user actions. I am particularly proud of how quickly I was able to adapt to JavaScript.


## Problems Faced
*Use this space to document and discuss any issues you faced while undertaking this challenge and how you solved them. We recommend doing this proactively as you experience and resolve the issues - make sure you don't forget! (Screenshots are helpful, though not required)*.

I was initially not strong or familiar with JavaScript, as I in the past have worked with TypeScript. As I progressed, I gained a solid understanding of the language and its syntax. I learned how to create functions to update, modify, and display values from the backend on the homepage. I particularly enjoyed learning JavaScript and found it intuitive and practical once I built momentum.

## Evaluation
*How did you feel about the challenge overall? Did some parts go better than others? Did you run out of time? If you were to do this again, and were given more time, what would you do differently?*

The most challenging aspect was developing a solid understanding of JavaScript. I also spent time troubleshooting setup issues and resolving a few early errors, but overall the experience was positive.
